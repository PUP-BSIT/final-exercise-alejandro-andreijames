            <em><strong>
                Reflecting on my journey in the Web Development course, 
                I can't help but see it as a rollercoaster ride, filled 
                with its fair share of lows and highs. At the outset, 
                every zero on an exercise felt like a devastating blow. 
                It was more than just a mark; it felt like a reflection 
                of my inability to keep up with the rapid pace of learning 
                new coding languages each week, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                Git, PHP, HTTP Cookies, and database management. This was 
                particularly challenging as a student with no background 
                in coding from my senior high school days, making it hard 
                to catch up with classmates who had taken ICT courses.

                The constant cycle of being introduced to new concepts, 
                trying to apply them under the pressure of time, and 
                often failing to complete exercises was incredibly draining. 
                I won't sugarcoat it – it was frustrating and disheartening. 
                There were moments when I questioned not just my competence 
                in the subject but my decision to take this course. However, 
                as time passed, I began to see these challenges in a different 
                light. I realized that these difficulties were not just 
                academic hurdles; they were life lessons. The course was 
                teaching us, in its unique way, what it feels like to be 
                in the field of web development. It was preparing us for 
                the real world, where setbacks are part of the journey 
                and resilience is key.
                
                One profound lesson was the emphasis on "Cooperation and 
                Teamwork over Competition." We learned that to achieve 
                something significant, hard work and teamwork are essential. 
                This course was not just about coding; it was about growing 
                as a valuable individual in the IT industry, understanding 
                the importance of proper netiquettes, and how to conduct 
                ourselves professionally in a digital environment.
                
                The devastation of those zeroes eventually gave way to 
                learning and understanding. It wasn't just about learning 
                to code; it was about learning to pick myself up after 
                a setback, to persevere through difficulties, and to find 
                solutions in the face of challenges. This realization 
                marked a turning point in my journey.
                
                Yes, the course was tiring – perhaps the most exhausting 
                I have ever taken. But it was also the most enriching. 
                Despite the initial frustrations and feelings of being 
                overwhelmed, I have learned immensely. Not just about 
                web development, but about myself, about persistence, 
                and about overcoming obstacles.
                
                As I near the end of this course, I look back with a sense 
                of accomplishment. The lows were undoubtedly tough, but 
                they were necessary for the highs – the moments of 
                understanding, the successful completion of a challenging 
                exercise, the sense of achievement after grasping a difficult 
                concept. This course, with all its rigors, has been a 
                profound learning experience, one that I will carry with me 
                as I move forward in my career and life.
